.SH NAME
.PP
The RDMX Fabric Provider
.SH OVERVIEW
.PP
The RDMX provider is an emulated provider that supports RDM endpoints
emulated over DGRAM endpoints.
.SH SUPPORTED FEATURES
.PP
TODO: The UDP provider supports a minimal set of features useful for sending
and receiving datagram messages over an unreliable endpoint.
.PP
\f[I]Endpoint types\f[] : The provider supports only endpoint type
\f[I]FI_EP_DGRAM\f[].
.PP
\f[I]Endpoint capabilities\f[] : The following data transfer interface
is supported: \f[I]fi_msg\f[].
.PP
\f[I]Modes\f[] : The provider does not require the use of any mode bits.
.PP
\f[I]Progress\f[] : The UDP provider supports both
\f[I]FI_PROGRESS_AUTO\f[] and \f[I]FI_PROGRESS_MANUAL\f[], with a
default set to auto.
However, receive side data buffers are not modified outside of
completion processing routines.
.SH LIMITATIONS
.PP
The UDP provider has hard-coded maximums for supported queue sizes and
data transfers.
These values are reflected in the related fabric attribute structures
.PP
EPs must be bound to both RX and TX CQs.
.PP
No support for selective completions or multi-recv.
.PP
No support for counters.
.SH RUNTIME PARAMETERS
.PP
No runtime parameters are currently defined.
